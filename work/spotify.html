                            Another programmer and I <strong>preprocessed Spotify Million Playsists Dataset (MPD) data, helped with collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm, qualitative evalutations and created the UI design for demo.</strong>
                            <br/> For this project, I worked with 3 programmers and 1 product manager. The other programmers preprocessed data for 160k Track Dataset (Spotify API) and coded for content-based recommendation algorithm.<br/>
                            <br/> While many music recommendation systems already exist in the market, they do not provide much flexibility for the user to customize.<br/>
                            <br/> From this project, we took a new and unique approach by implementing a combination of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms on two different datasets. <br/>
                            <br/> Then, we validated the outcome by evaluating with accuracy metrics and comparing to Spotify’s existing system’s outputs. <br/>

                        Most of the existing open-source solutions typically use only one type of approach between collaborative and content-based. Collaborative filtering only approach causes an uneven distribution of data, as popular items get more popular and thus be recommended
                        even more frequently and less popular items get “drowned out”. On the other hand, the content-based filtering only approach tends to ignore user patterns and social trends. Spotify’s current recommendation system is fully automated
                        using historical data. It has no consideration for user input, no way to reset user data and start fresh, and no flexibility to “tweak” algorithm if users are unsatisfied with the recs. We combine both approaches to recommend newly
                        released, still unpopular, music based on existing user patterns and their taste in music. Our solution gives the users the option to input their preferences for better user experience.

                        We used pandas to check for any duplicate playlists or null values in the tracks and found that there are none. Besides the tracks, we included some metadata of the playlist for analysis: number of albums, number of artists, number of tracks, and number
                        of followers. These fields are used to identify the diversity and the popularity of the playlists.

                        From Fig 1, we can see that all these fields have a high peak and a long tail except for the number of followers, suggesting that the dataset is noisy and contains outliers. The following bar plots help us in detecting the quantiles and outliers.

                        <br/> Although there are some outliers as shown in the figure above, the “nearest-neighbor” approach for generating recommendations using our system means that the outputs are unaffected by their existence.
                        <br/> Collaborative filtering often suffers from the “cold start” problem. Therefore, it is always good to know popular tracks/artists/albums when users provide little information about their playlists. Here we generated the top

                        Our initial analysis on the 160k tracks and their features shows that there are no missing or null values in the dataset. In the cases where users wish to see a global recommendation before inputting a song or playlist, we look at the “popularity” feature
                        to recommend songs that are most popular. We use different similarity metrics that are affected by the feature values’ range. So to prepare this data, we normalize many of the features using Sklearn’s MinMaxScalar. For content-based
                        filtering, we mostly care about the audio features and some of the song’s information, such as popularity and year released. Three of these features (explicit, mode, and key) are discrete features (binary or integer), while the
                        other 12 are continuous floats. Histograms of these 15 normalized features are shown below in Figure 4.

                        <br/> From Fig 4, we see that several fields have skewed distributions, such as duration_ms, because there exist outliers with extreme values while the rest have a much lower average. However, since we are mainly using similarity
                        measures that are based on distance or cosine, the outliers (farther) are not as important to resolve as abnormally high variance in the data. To account for this “bias”/noise, we performed further statistical analysis and calculated
                        the coefficient of variation for each column and the standard error of the mean. The results showed that “explicit” had a much higher coefficient of variance at ~3.25. As a result, we decided to discard the column to remove noise.

                        Firstly, we processed MPD to a utility matrix to perform user-user collaborative filtering. In this case, the user is the playlist, and the item is the track. The Jaccard similarity is calculated to measure the distance between playlists. However, due
                        to the number of playlists and the number of unique tracks, we used MinHash and Locality Sensitive Hashing to approximate nearest neighbors of playlists. After finding the top-k nearest neighbors, we computed the real Jaccard Similarity
                        to exclude false positives. To increase the recall rate, we would find 3k nearest neighbors when we need to obtain k true nearest neighbors. The following plot shows the predicted Jaccard similarity and real value after finding
                        10 neighbor playlists of a query input on about 110of the entire dataset.

                        In order to find songs that are similar to the user’s input song, we initially utilized four similarity metrics: Cosine Similarity, Inner Product, Pearson Correlation, and Euclidean Distance. Since the milestone, we’ve also added Spearman Correlation
                        and Manhattan Distance as two additional metrics. For each similarity, we find the top-k similar items to the input song, using the 14 features shown above in Figure 4 (excluding “explicit”).
                        <br/> For input handling, we want to solve the “cold start problem” mentioned earlier and still output recommendations even if the input does not exist within our dataset. In order to get the audio features for these new songs,
                        we use the python library Spotipy to gain access to Spotify’s Web API. Our system can take an input of a list of song titles and artists and retrieve the best match from Spotify library with our own client ID.
                        <br/> To output a coalesced ranked list using the separate metrics, we combine the scores of 6 separate metrics into a single final ranking by averaging them. While test running the combined algorithm, we noticed Pearson and Spearman
                        were noticeably slower than other metrics and became the performance bottlenecks. To fix this, we implemented K-Means clustering to narrow down the size of the dataset that we apply the similarity algorithm to by splitting it into
                        8 clusters (default value) and choosing the one that the input belongs to, according to the model.
                        <br/> In implementing the audio feature sliders that differentiate our project from Spotify’s current recommendation system, we want to incorporate a user input to specify custom weights for features. In formulating the code and
                        approach, we found two interpretations:
                        <br/>1. Users choose which columns are more important or less important for them (e.g. "I want recommendations that, most importantly, have the same level of acousticness as my input song/playlist. ").
                        <br/>2. Users choose which columns they want to change or modify from input (e.g. "I want recommendations that resemble my input BUT an acoustic version with less speechiness. ").

                        we used the following formula to apply input weights to the similarity metrics:

                        <br/>For the second, we simply translate the input scale of 0-10 on the UI to a value between 0 and 1 and replace the specified column with that value, since our dataset is normalized.

                        In order to combine both methods, we assign a weight to the recommendations of the content based system and another weight to the recommendations of the collaborative filtering system. The weights determine how much of an influence each system has on
                        the final output and should sum up to one. We then multiply these weights to the similarity score of each recommendation. The final output will be songs whose scaled similarity score is the highest:

                        <br/>We then evaluate the combined algorithms. The combined predictions are calculated by using the weighted average as previously discussed. We did a grid search to find the weight to combine two algorithms.

                        <br> As shown above, the MPD and Spotify datasets come from different distributions. Thus, adding the content-based filtering will add some random noise and then lower the accuracy. It seems that the best weights to use are those
                        which weigh Collaborative Filtering more heavily.

                        Due to constraints of the MPD dataset’s size (~30GB), we were unable to build and host a fully-functional online platform for the recommendation engine. Thus, to gauge user feedback, we prepared two components that the platform would have consisted of:
                        a user interface and the ranked recommendations. Then, we created a form and planned to survey a number of potential users to ask them to compare the outputs of our system to those of Spotify’s current “Mix Radio. The resulting
                        response would provide us with insight on our project’s realistic value in usage. First, we designed a mockup UI. The inputs are the user's provided song list and user’s preference of different sound feature sliders (shown is of
                        interpretation 2, explained previously). Users can change the sliders to vary the weights on each of the respective audio features.

                        inputs with our system and asked users how many songs they like and if, as a whole, they preferred our recommendation output over Spotify’s. We asked 20 people each (100 total) to test our system and fill out the survey. The result
                        showed about 37% of tested users preferred our recommended song list. We also found that users typically liked two of the three songs we recommend and that the number of songs they liked was on average ~1.78. We also asked them
                        to rate the playlist as a whole (1-10 scale, the higher the better). We found that the average rating was ~6.32.

                        The final weights between Content-Based recommendations and Collaborative-Based recommendations provided us with a unique insight into the nature of recommending songs. What we learned was that audio features may not be a key factor that influences whether
                        users will add the track to a playlist. Just because a song is very similar sounding doesn't mean that it is what users want to listen to. It might indicate that the best recommendations are ones that are similar but yet provide
                        different sound variability. In addition, it also shows us that for song recommendations, the opinions and tastes of different users are very useful in providing recommendations for users.

                        at 37%, but was more than we had thought. Furthermore, we gathered that participants “liked” or enjoyed the majority of the songs we outputted to them based on their input. Additionally, many participants voiced their appreciation
                        of the ability or at least having the option to customize or have control of the recommendations to some degrees of personal preference. These results identified further work needed to improve the outputs and reconfirmed our system’s

                        TIn order to provide a better recommendation system, we took a unique approach in combining Content Based and Collaborative Based filtering. As a result, we were able to build a new recommendation system that is capable of providing a more user-controlled

                        For the final combined recommendation, we take both content based and collaborative filtering separately. From our analysis, we found that using the output of the content based system into the input of the collaborative filtering system is useful especially
                        when the input playlist is small.

                        <br>In addition, instead of combining predictions after the LSH, we can utilize audio features to reduce the dimension of the playlist dataset to improve the speed and the performance. For example, even though the song is not strictly
                        matched, two playlists may also be similar if their songs have similar audio features. Neither algorithms can deal with the “cold start” problem, and our current solution is to recommend top/trending tracks when the input playlist
                        is empty.

                        <br> As for building a usable product, we hope to create a website with a complete user-facing UI. Users will be able to input songs and adjust sliders that control the weights of each audio feature.
